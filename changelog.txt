Changelog for SumoToolBox

6-30-2021 0.10.0
*   [General] Major Code Refactor! Most tabs now inherit code/UI from a base class.
*   [General] An adapter model is now in place that should allow reading and writing to/from other services. The
    first 2 adapters are the Sumo Logic (duh) and filesystem adapters. The filesystem adapter replaces the
    "backup" and "restore" buttons on each tab. Look for more adapters soon (Git? Multi org deploy?)
*   [General] Most operations are now multithreaded. You should see up to a 10x speedup when manipulating multiple
    objects. The "source update" tab greatly benefits from multithreading.
*   [General] With multi threading comes STATUS BARS! HUZZAH! Note that in most tabs status bars update in
    "per object" increments. This means that if you are copying only 1 thing you go from 0 to 100 percent completion
    without any intermediate steps.
*   [General] Split "Users and Roles" into 2 tabs, "Users" and "Roles". This was done to simplify implementation of the
    adapter system.
*   [General] Split "Monitors and Connections" into 2 tabs, "Monitors" and "Connections". This was done to simplify
    implementation of the adapter system.
*   [General] A new wiki is available here: https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologictoolbox/wiki
*   [General] "wiki" and "report issue" entries are now available in the help menu.
*   [Orgs SDK] Added the correct GA endpoint to the SDK. It was previously the alpha endpoint.
*   [Organizations] Removed CSE credits and storage from the view as they don't exist in the API at the moment.
*   [Content] Add an "Include Connections" checkbox. If checked this will make sure that any connections used by
    a scheduled search will also be copied/imported along with the saved search. If unchecked then the scheduled search
    will be stripped of it's connections, in effect making it just a regular search.
*   [Users and Roles] Added an "Include Roles" checkbox. If checked then copying/importing the user will replicate
    all of that user's roles to the target org. If unchecked then only "Administrators" and/or "Analysts" membership
    will be replicated to the destination org. If the user was not a member of either of these roles and this box
    is unchecked then the user will be made an "Analyst" in the destination org.
*   [Rules] Added "Rules" Tab. This tab allows management of CSE Rules. This only works for accounts for which CSE is
    enabled AND with unified logins/APIs (legacy instances are not supported.)
*   [Custom Insights] Added "Custom Insights" Tab. This tab allows management of CSE Custom Insights. This only works
    for accounts for which CSE is enabled AND with unified logins/APIs (legacy instances are not supported.) The copy
    operation for Custom Insights will copy any associated custom rules as well.
*   [Log Mappings] Added "Log Mappings" Tab. This tab allows management of CSE custom log mappings. This only works
    for accounts for which CSE is enabled AND with unified logins/APIs (legacy instances are not supported.)

1-6-2021 0.9.1
*   [Collectors] The new Cloud 2 Cloud sources added by Sumo Logic have a different JSON definition/schema than other
    source types. This change caused errors when attempting access/manipulate these types of sources in previous versions.
    This is now fixed in 0.9.1
*   [Source Update] The new Cloud 2 Cloud sources added by Sumo Logic have a different JSON definition/schema than other
    source types. This change caused errors when attempting access/manipulate these types of sources in previous versions.
    This is now fixed in 0.9.1
*   [Collectors] Fixed bug where if 2 folders had the same name it got confused. This was possible in global folders
    because 2 users can have the same name and the root level folders are represented by user names.
*   [Users and Roles] Fixed bug where if 2 users had the same name it got confused. This is possible because e-mail
    address is actually the unique identifier for each account (along with the internal 'id' number.)


12-12-2020 0.9
*   [Source Update] Added the ability to update the source category of all sources in your target list. Please be careful
    as you can cause all sorts of mayhem with this feature if you don't know what you are doing. Also remember, don't
    exit the tool until you've checked your work. The undo button will work until you exit the tool.
*   [Monitors and Connections] Added "Monitors and Connections" tab which allows the manipulation and viewing of webhook
    connections as well as monitors (the new alerting feature.) These were added in the same tab as monitors are
    potentially dependent on connections. The tab is designed to optionally copy the connections upon which a monitor
    depends along with the monitor itself.
*   [Collectors] Added cloud and server icons to represent hosted and installed collectors.
*   [Collectors] Added a set of radio buttons to filter collectors based on type and status. You can now choose between
    All Collectors, Only Hosted Collectors, Only Installed Collectors, and Installed Collectors that are "dead" (no
    longer sending.)
*   [General] Made the starting size of the JSON viewer window a bit bigger.
*   [SDK] Added Support for Monitors
*   [SDK] Added Support for SAML Configs
*   [General] Changed how tabs are loaded. They are now loaded dynamically from the modules dir. This has had some
    impact on the order of the tabs in the UI. It's alphabetical now (except for search.) Sorry if you were used to
    the old way.
*   [Orgs SDK] Updated the orgs SDK to work with the new Orgs Beta API.
*   [Organizations] The triumphant return of the Organizations tab. The orgs API is restricted to Credits licenses
    now so only one "create org" button. More to come here as the beta starts up and v1.0 of orgs is released.
    Also note that the buttons on this tab will be disabled unless you are in the Organizations beta, the launch date
    of which is TBA as of this entry.


10-29-2020 0.8
*   Fixed this file (the changelog) to be descending (new stuff at the top instead of the bottom.)
*   [Content] Fixed the content find/replace/copy functionality to work with new style dashboards
*   Added JSON view button to most panes. This will show you the JSON that defines the selected object. The viewer
is pretty basic but it does have search capability. Type in your search term and click the Up or Down arrow to search
in that direction. There is currently no context menu but you can copy from the window using ctrl-c or command-c
depending on your computer. I may update this viewer later to be a bit more advanced (maybe an alternate collapsible
tree view?)
*   [Scheduled Views] Fixed bug where the right side of scheduled views pane was disabled
*   [Source Update] Updated font to match the app standard font (Waree 12)
*   Added shared module for classes and functions that are shared by all panes (for instance the new JSON viewer)
*   Fixed a bug that was preventing mask rule updates from working in the "source update" tab.
*   Fixed a bug that was preventing debug mode from working
*   Added a Partitions tab to manipulate partitions (no general partition yet though, waiting on API update). Note that
copying a partition only creates that partition in the destination, it does NOT copy the data stored in the partition.

09-26-2020 0.7.1

*   Fixed the collector search bar which somehow got broken in the last update
*   Updated the "Find/Replace/Copy" Content feature to work with new style dashboards
*   Fixed a bug in which the content panel couldn't always show some folders in "admin recommended" and "global folders"
modes
*   Added new method to sumologic.py: get_source_with_etag which returns the etag header as well. This is required for
the update_source method to work.
*   Fixed the update_source method in sumologic.py. It was encoding the source json improperly and kicking back an error.
*   Temporarily disabled the MAM tab until that API is closer to release.
*   Added the "source update" tab which allows mass updates of source processing rules on sources. If you have a lot of
collectors then refreshing this tab may take a while (like 40 minutes if you have 10,000 collectors.) Be patient.

06-10-2020 0.7

*   Added Multi Account Management support for large Enterprises and Service Providers. This is not a globally available API
must be turned on by Sumo Logic for specific customers/partners. To enable MAM support in Sumotoolbox you must edit your
config file and enter your "partner_name" in the appropriate field. If you do not know your partner name contact Sumo Logic.
If you are leveraging the built-in Credential Store in SumoToolBox you also need to specify which of your credential presets
is authorized to perform MAM functions by editing the "authorized_preset" field in the INI file.
*   Added a new SDK for Multi Account Management. Look for the file called "sumologic_mam.py" under the modules folder.
I broke this out as a separate SDK because the API endpoint for MAM is different than the rest of the SDKs and the rate
limiting may be different as well. Plus only a small number of customers/partners will be able to use this feature.
*   Added a proper back off algorithm to the standard Sumo Logic SDK to deal with rate limiting (previously wait times
between calls were hard coded.)
*   Updated the Content Find/Replace/Copy functionality with a new algorithm that should work much better. The "new hotness"
recurses the data structure whereas the "old and busted" just turned the whole structure to a massive string and tried to
find source categories that way (problematic with all the escape characters in the exported JSON.)
*   Moved all custom dialogs out of the dialog.py file and into their calling module.
*   Did some code cleanup in sumologic.py. I don't believe any functionality changed (fingers crossed)
*   Rewrote Find/Replace/Copy dialog setupUI method to use layouts instead of geometry. It's still not quite right but it's
much better than it was. If anyone is better at Qt5 dynamic form generation than I am (not hard) and wants to suggest
improvements please suggest away.
*   Added a Users and Roles tab. This allows copying, backup, restore, and deletion of Users and Roles. Users are currently
exported with all of their role info attached. Additionally when users are copied/restored the roles they belong to are
created as well. In the future I may make this optional (i.e. remove the user from roles interactively (with user input)
before creating the user, but for now it just happens.
*   Added config file update functionality. This should ensure that your ini file is updated with the latest options and
default values without overwriting existing values.
*   All backup files will now have a extension that indicates what sort of object they are.

03-09-2020 0.6

*   major code refactor. Each tab (except for search) is now it's own class and imports it's own tab layout. This makes the
project much more modular and easier to work on. The main class is nicely trimmed down. This should also make it
much simpler for people to contribute functionality to the project in the future.
*   The project directory structure has changed as a result of the refactor. The modules folder now contains all the additional
modules and classes. If you're looking for sumologic.py to use as a python SDK it's now in the "modules" folder.
*   Added scheduled view support in it's own tab (currently scheduled views are set to start "now"-ish when they are created (through
copying or restoring.) If you want to set them to retroactively process older data you'll need to edit them in the SumoLogic UI
after they are copied/restored.
*   Changed the tab visual style to make it beautiful :-)
*   Added tooltips

03-01-2020 0.5.1-beta

*   fixed bug that kept more than one selected item from being copied in the content pane
*   fixed bug that limited the number of collectors displayed to 1000
*   fixed bug required you to click "OK" each time a set of sources was copied to a collector when copying to multiple collectors
*   added search feature to collector list
*   renamed "collectors" method to "get_collectors" in sumologic.py
*   added "get_collectors_sync" synchronous method to sumologic.py

01-30-2020  0.5-beta

*   Added FER tab with support for Field Extraction Rule copy/backup/restore (find/replace/copy buttons are disabled and will be implemented in a future release.
*   Added splash screen logo
*   Added "Settings" menu with ability to change logging level for debugging purposes.
*   Added Icons to Content Pane
*   Added ability to copy multiple sources to multiple target get_collectors
*   Switched from Darkstyle Theme to qtmodern due to bugs in Darkstyle
*   Switched from pyqt5 to qtpy
