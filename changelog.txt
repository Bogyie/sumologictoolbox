03-09-2020 0.6

*major code refactor. Each tab (except for search) is now it's own class and imports it's own tab layout. This makes the
project much more modular and easier to work on. The main class is nicely trimmed down. This should also make it
much simpler for people to contribute functionality to the project in the future.

*The project directory structure has changed as a result of the refactor. The modules folder now contains all the additional
modules and classes. If you're looking for sumologic.py to use as a python SDK it's now in the "modules" folder.

*Added scheduled view support in it's own tab (currently scheduled views are set to start "now"-ish when they are created (through
copying or restoring.) If you want to set them to retroactively process older data you'll need to edit them in the SumoLogic UI
after they are copied/restored.

*Changed the tab visual style to make it beautiful :-)
*Added tooltips
