[Credential Store]

# credential_store_implementation
# This determines whether to use a full read/write credential store, a read-only custom credential store, or no
# credential store.
#
# Valid settings are as follows:
#
# "built_in" - This is the default setting. Use this to use the provided credential store or if you implement your own
#              credential store with full read/write capabilities
# "read_only"- Use this if you want to implement your own read-only version of the CredentialDB class to connect
#              to some other credential store. Choosing this option will disable the Create/Delete Cred Database
#              buttons. If your implementation requires a username/id as well as a password also see the
#              "username" setting in this file.
# "none"     - This setting will turn off the Create/Load/Delete Cred Database buttons. The user will no longer have
#              the ability to use a credential store
credential_store_implementation = built_in

# username
#
# If this is set then sumologictoolbox will pass this value to the CredentialDB class as a parameter. This is ignored
# by the built-in credential store but may be useful if you implement your own CredentialDB class that requires both
# a username/id and a password. The accompanying  password is always entered into the UI of course.

# API Endpoints
#
# This is the list of the available SumoLogic endpoints. You can add your own endpoints but be careful about removing
# endpoints as any credential presets that rely on a missing endpoint will cause issues. If you add an endpoint
# make sure it is indented the same way as the others are.
